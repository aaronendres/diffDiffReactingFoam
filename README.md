# diffDiffReactingFoam

OpenFOAM solver for detailed chemical kinetics with differential diffusion effects.

This solver is based on the reactive solver reactingFoam delivered with the the open-source CFD package OpenFOAM 5.1. It is enhanced by a detailed diffusivity model including Soret diffusion. A detailed description of the diffusion model can be found in the following publication:
